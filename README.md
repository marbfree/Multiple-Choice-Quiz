# Multiple Choice Quiz

## Description

As a boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript that stores my high scores to gauge my progress.  Each question is worth one point.  If you answer correctly, move on to the next question.  If you answer wrong, you loose 15 seconds off the time.  

## Usage

Click the "Let's Go!" button to begin the quiz.  View high scores from the high scores link on the home page.
